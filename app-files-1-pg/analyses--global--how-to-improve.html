      and codes them thematically.

              <span>I recommend that we honor berea&#39;s historic mission of equity for faculty and staff, rather than thinking of equity as only something students in our community deserve. this would mean that committee recommendations are honored. this would also mean that administrators respect the shared governance process and allow time for real discussion and debate for important issues, and administrators will henceforth cease to circumvent the share governance process when their own poor planning has led to a time crunch. this would mean that faculty and staff have work-life balance and equitable workloads. faculty teaching and advisee loads would be internally comparable and certainly not more than one standard deviation from the median or mean, and they would also be comparable to those offered at other small liberal arts colleges that are located in areas with a similar cost of living to berea. faculty salaries are also comparable and certainly not more than one standard deviation from the median or mean of those offered at other small liberal arts colleges that are located in areas with a similar cost of living to berea. my strongest statement is that faculty workloads can simply not remain so incredibly  inequitable as thy are currently.  to fail to do so is to fail to serve berea&#39;s historic mission, which is supposedly why we are all here.  i sincerely believe in berea&#39;s mission, and i am very hopeful for very significant change under new presidential leadership or i would have accepted one of the several offers that i have received in recent years, each of which was for very substantially more money. [redacted identifying information] so i have seen berea in good times and in less good times. recent years have been the worst of times in a large number of ways. hence, deciding upon just &#34;number one thing that the institution needs to  improve the workplace&#34; to focus on here, is very hard for me. we have had the largest bleeding of tenured faculty in the entire history of the college with the exception of during the [year]  where attractive retirement incentives were offered.   here are some of the many, many choices that i have had to chose among: administration that very regularly circumvents shared governance, failure of vps to celebrate and even communicate, lack of presidential-level mentoring and oversight of vps, the reduction of the dean of the faculty from a vp-level position, appointments of bumbling internally hired vps and other senior administrators like the current dean [redacted identifying information] who don&#39;t listen or frankly even respond to multiple emails, equitable teaching workloads for faculty, equitable advising workloads for faculty (some faculty have had 40+ primary advisees in some terms), salaries that are utterly non-competitive in a number of fields (even when compared to other small liberal arts colleges in localities with similar costs of living) and a response from the administration of &#34;oh well..., what can we do given our mission?&#34;, unfair hiring practices that have very significantly advantaged internal white men who are seen as &#34;nice&#34; and affordable over much more qualified candidates who demanded a salary comparable to elsewhere, even when that appointment is contrary to unanimous search committee recommendations, infrastructure that has been failing for decades in some classroom buildings (like [building name]) that have ceilings falling in on classrooms yet whose renovations or replacements keep getting postponed for unspecified reasons, new building planning that heavily leverages lean process planning and lacks oversight, squashing new buildings to the point where they not only fail to be 50-100 year buildings but they fail to even meet needs on the very move in date. let&#39;s be clear that lean planning comes out of a manufacturing setting where meeting short term goals is essential and is utterly inappropriate for building a 50 or 100-year building because it fails to consider growth trajectories, and adding on to a building is much more expensive than adding expansion footage from the start.  yes, that past list is an indicator of my high level of dissatisfaction with the ways the administration operated in the recent past. which is why i have very seriously considered leaving. one of the senior faculty who did leave recently told me personally that &#34;people do not leave their job, they leave their boss&#34;, and they explained that they meant the dean [redacted identifying information] who had failed to support their department. if the president is to be at all effective (which i do hope [he/she/they] will be), i think it is essential that [he/she/they]  better mentor her vps and high-level deans—these could have been effective administrators, but have not been.  my strongest statement is that faculty workloads can simply not remain so incredibly  inequitable.</span>

              <span>My greatest concern at this time is that the academic dean has too much power over hiring decisions and decisions about whether or not a position is tenure-track, or a particular length (1-year, 3-year, etc.)  our department has been set up to fail many times when trying to recruit the best possible candidates for our department.  the search committee decision has been disregarded in the past, and a tenure line taken away, to be replaced with a three-year position.  the led to a failed search because our candidate of choice took a tenure-track position offer.  the contributions our department makes to the campus have not been valued.</span>

(1) recognize my role and responsibilities as director, not when i force myself into conversations (as had been normal, but i find the need to do it again), (2) communicate expectations clearly and to be honest about evaluations, (3) not to make big decisions without involving stakeholders, (4) admit errors and problems, both in present and past.    as for support faculty: i work 50 hour weeks, which is 20 hours less than i worked before covid.  i don&#39;t have time to go up for [redacted faculty position], even though i could have long ago.  the only place is to lessen the course load or take a leave of absence.  i&#39;m pretty bitter, but i&#39;m not going to sacrifice my health or family get make more money and gain recognition, which makes me care less about berea because it could, in that way, care less about me.</span>

              <span>The number one thing that this institution could do is pay us more without expecting more. the culture here makes me suspicious that any wage increase would entail an expectation that we surrender even more of our time when honestly, it would only make it so that we have a more equitable salary to colleagues outside of this institution. leadership at berea does not have sufficient experience outside of berea and therefore is unaware of the standards of the field outside of berea. being paid a significantly greater amount would help me swallow the indignities of working here. also, let this salary bump be equitable, not equal so that inequitable pay salaries are addressed. i see a difference in how women of color faculty are compensated and these gaps are only augmented as the years go on due to pay compression.</span>

              <span>Berea college has an incredibly special mission, one very dear to my heart, to serve all peoples of appalachia regardless of their origins, religion, creed, or lifestyle. as an undergraduate, i found teaching was my gift and i entered graduate studies to equip myself to give back in this way. it has been my passion and my love. [redacted identifying information]. most importantly, i am an example of what they can, and i hope they will, achieve. the last several decades at berea college have given me this opportunity. for that, i am grateful. it was the very surreal but wonderful manifestation of my goals, hopes, and dreams coming to berea college. my experiences in the classroom have been the most satisfying and rewarding of all my life’s efforts. experiencing with students their personal and intellectual growth has been more than gratifying. i cannot express my feelings to you through mere words alone. a love for the region and its people coupled with both persistence and perseverance these past several decades have driven and sustained my efforts. sadly, it has often been the sole factor upon which to judge my worth at the college. unfortunately, other experiences outside the classroom led me to expect the abysmal results from the last job satisfaction survey. that such a high percentage of faculty and staff have seriously considered leaving was not at all shocking. i too have considered multiple times, leaving the college for pursuits other than teaching although i have been exceptionally successful at it. my upbringing and personal ethics make me feel uncomfortable touting my gifts and talents to anyone. yet, i feel it necessary to include in this narrative to help those that will listen, if anyone actually does, to better understand and interpret my experiences that have not led, but pushed, me to commit the following to narrative. the major problem is institutional inbreeding for and within an administrative echo chamber. from faculty to administrative positions, this has caused so many professional, personal, and unnecessary difficulties, setbacks, troubles, complications, and worries for faculty and staff. i would add that this has been a consistent problem since i arrived and as i have heard, was gaining steam a few years before i came. provosts, deans, and chairs of divisions, department heads, committee leaders have been brought up from the ranks. every dean since i arrived has been pulled from the existing faculty pool. problem is, they also brought along their subjectivity and biases in favor of friends and others with whom they have shared common views on governance, academics, research and so forth. most, if not all of these people were more than extremely ambitious and unabashedly and severely sycophantic to the detriment of their peers. when one dean stepped down, another of their obsequious peers was chosen from an “inner circle” cycle after cycle. further exacerbating the problem, berea college has a consistently bad habit of hiring former students or filling office manager and other clerical/assistant positions from in-house employee pools. these hires have often treated others that earned undergraduate degrees elsewhere as second-class citizens. these staff have acted on the premise that their view of berea’s mission was superior and absolutely necessary for the college’s advancement. they alone could hold the keys to the kingdom. the inbreeding has become so concentrated to the point that administration, committees, academic departments and more cannot properly fulfill their mandates due to low morale and hostile work environments. the inner workings of the college, as it exists today, are simply a circus and the clowns are running the show! now as all seasoned faculty understand, megalomaniacs and sycophants will always be a part of any workplace. in truth, i fully realize that competition is good for the growth and development of any academic program. nevertheless, when unchecked, as it has been at berea for so long, it destroys morale, especially when only the most ambitious are appointed to leadership positions. cliques, born of ambition and cemented by shared dogma create these echo chambers. shared views on governance, tenure and promotion criteria, strategic planning and more become self-sustaining, self-serving, and strongly ingrained in administrative processes. how did this happen? one particular president seems to have gotten the ball rolling. [he/she/they] was never wrong and would argue any point ad nauseum until the “opponent” yielded, even if facts were explicated clearly and distinctly. anyone denouncing publicly some brainchild of this president could suffer vindictive repercussions. many faculty would not dare voice an opinion. junior faculty dared not voice any opposition; tenure and promotion could be jeopardized! when the provost disagreed publicly with policy too often, [he/she/they] was replaced. when [his/her/their] replacement disagreed too much, the provost position was eliminated altogether, again insulating those in power from faculty. deans, chairs of departments, and others in governance roles were chosen from the faculty body to become mouthpieces that enabled and expedited the president’s wishes. naturally, faculty moving up through the ranks meant that their friends and fawners within the “inner circle” could enjoy special privileges. abusive and unprofessional behavior of privileged faculty were often overlooked. many instances of ill treatment of those outside this inner circle by the privileged were simply ignored or blatantly and shamelessly justified by administrators. those outside the inner circle have had little to no voice and truly little advocacy. prejudiced decisions have made professional life intolerable for those not in line with lincoln hall. invitations for promotion and granting of endowed chair positions have been and are still, often reserved for the privileged only. administration promoted the current division structure as the only governance model that would effectively increase cooperation between departments that shared certain levels of academic compatibility and mutualism. we were told this structure would create a palpable synergism in the workplace. in contrast, i have seen and still see the same level of cooperation between departments as before. in contrast, i saw less and less cooperation over time between colleagues within departments, especially in professional activities besides teaching. unhealthy competition to outdo one’s colleagues and maintain, or gain, status and favor with administration increased. naturally, it would in such cases when leadership fosters it. it is easier to create a syndicate of cronies to fulfill one’s wishes. these associates have voluntarily absorbed the brunt of faculty pushback and therein solidified their privileged status. since its inception, the division structure has only served to further insulate administration. unfortunately, this chicanery has continued for the last several decades at an institution that is supposed to value equality and inclusion while lauding merit. but actions speak louder than words. woe to you that voice opinions contrary to administration or its inner circle! it is well known that administrators have been nothing but prejudiced in favor of the sycophants, the majority of which have been extremely inept instructors. i quickly discovered that if you cannot teach, grovel to, agree with, and speak for administration and you will be able to move up through the ranks by such means alone. merit is not required! all you have to do is say “yes” to those above. faculty awards and recognition are given to sycophants and friends or cronies of sycophants. these same privileged people appear over and over on video screens in our buildings and in the berea alumni magazine. again, merit is not required! letters students write in favor of worthy candidates are passed over in lieu of recommendations solicited from students through political means. those that serve on these committees readily admit that political biases have major influence. those that are able to contribute large sums of money also have more influence and openly use this to ensure their cronies are recognized. so called acts of selflessness and giving often serve to veil self-serving objectives. you can only recognize these actions if you are paying attention. these deeds can be deceiving because they look great on paper and in the berea college publications. i have witnessed more times than i can recount however sycophantic faculty literally tripping over themselves to praise students favored by administration or trustees, all in the presence of other students. these students noticed and mentioned their feeling less worthy of faculty attentions. students should never be made to feel this way. all are worthy of our best efforts! [redacted identifying information]  how would administration know who merited pay raises and promotion based on one’s professional effectiveness and achievement? merit? they simply would not and don’t. no one reads the faculty activity reports. i have included at the end of several reports a plea for any administrator to respond in any capacity. no responses have materialized. i was looking for feedback and help with serious matters. further, jealousy, vindictiveness, and selfish actions to maintain good standing with administration means that department and division chairs usually discriminate against those that are not only talented instructors but are also passionate about the professional and personal development of students in their classrooms. some faculty crave the sole favor and devotion of students. this behavior is an utter lack of respect for oneself, students, and fellow faculty. they go out of their way to “help” minority students while neglecting those in need of attention. [redacted identifying information] both interactions were with faculty that have repeatedly demonstrated that they value more their own status with administration than supporting and promoting the work of colleagues. why should they? they too have been given privileged status, have lots of money to donate, and feel they can get away with anything because they are insulated along with administration. this behavior from colleagues and administrators shows a complete and total lack of personal character and an obvious neglect of leadership. leadership means listening, caring, treating others as you would have them treat you. why? because the ultimate goal of leadership is to facilitate the work of all those in your charge. equip them to do the best job possible. encourage them. this cannot be done in the vacuum of an administrative echo chamber. when leaders take their cues only from those in the inner circle trying to get ahead of everyone else, of course inaccurate information is passed along about colleagues not in the circle, and professional reputations are tarnished. those with fresh ideas, should be given a chance to influence, if for no other reason than to provide fodder for thought and creativity. as a matter of course, morale will suffer because only those in the inner circle that “play the game” get ahead. what is worse, the satisfaction from belonging to something greater than one’s own self cannot be accomplished when people are demoralized and underappreciated in this way. eventually, personnel finally throw up their hands knowing there is nothing anyone can do. most importantly, we cannot meet our ultimate goal of teaching students to become independent thinkers that will serve others. self-serving faculty cannot set the proper example. and yes, students observe this and understand more than we give them credit for! moreover, they discuss their instructor’s actions with peers, and they ask other faculty to provide explanations for other’s professional misconduct that oftentimes, we cannot and should not provide! as if the stress of academic life here at berea college could be worse, the echo bubble from which administration operates has created an additional stress on most faculty, especially for those without tenure. research expectations have become disproportionate to faculty’s ability to meet them and retain sanity. i do agree that both research and scholarship are an important part of teaching. however, it should be conducted in support of our teaching, not to satisfy some capricious and irrelevant benchmark. nevertheless, administration has often been ignorant of significant differences in scholarship between disciplines. administration has also dictated their expectations that faculty publish only in specified outlets for, i feel, the prestige these potentially bring to the college. micromanagement of research activities does not end there! we are expected to maintain a remarkably high and constant plethora of research activities. administration has also deviated from the statements in the faculty manual and have decided the professional fates of those that fail to publish an expected amount over a given time. attendance of professional meetings and conferences, abstracts, and presentations have been ignored during tenure and promotion decisions in favor of book or journal publications. this is often the case even when research was conducted primarily to involve students! it is obvious why assistant and associate faculty are often stressed to the point of throwing in the towel. we lose individuals that are talented teachers. morale takes another hit especially when we claim teaching is our first priority! those not shown appreciation for their efforts when denied promotion will not be able to give their best under such suffocating circumstances. i [redacted identifying information] feel as if i have suffocated under many similar expectations. it has affected my teaching. no wonder turnover of our faculty is so high. nonetheless, i am again not shocked given the current working environment. i would be remiss if i did not mention the lack of facilities and graduate students often needed to publish at the levels expected. we are not equipped with human or other resources to conduct the research expected by administration. the number of contact hours with students also limits the time for research. as we all know, publishing any work requires a great deal of effort. with regard to our scientist colleagues, initial research can often fail to yield results worthy of publishing. in these cases, its often necessary to test and compare different methodologies before one can generate publishable results. junior tenure-track colleagues do not have the privilege of time. yet, administration piles on the pressure by constantly nagging these faculty to provide specific timelines for publishing. what nonsense! what a complete lack of support! no wonder so many want to leave for greener pastures. less emphasis on research is necessary if we’re going to maintain high standards for teaching and junior faculty shouldn’t take the lion’s share to appease administration or accreditation bodies. moreover, we are expected to continue research throughout the summers when we are not getting paid to do such. if research is required to support teaching, which is supposed to be our priority, should we not be compensated for such efforts?  [redacted identifying information] i feel the emphasis should be on research not necessarily to publish, but to broaden and strengthen our ability to teach within our disciplines. the current view stretches the faculty’s time and efforts too thin! morale and efforts also suffer because salary and compensation are abysmal for most. again, as other colleagues have stated before, berea college expects its faculty to be excellent teachers as well as seasoned researchers, club advisors, labor supervisors, academic advisors, chaperones, committee members, and more. administration expects us to go beyond the requirements of our employment contracts. i, as well as many others, do so because we enjoy playing a role in our student’s development in and out of the classroom setting. yet, administration also expects the body faculty to accept compensation for these services, efforts, and activities, at the median level of our benchmark schools. to further the insult, we are told by the current dean that we are required to work through the summers in spite of our contracts clearly stating that we work from august 15 to may 15 each year. many of us, again, work to further ourselves during summers regardless. nevertheless, to force and bully all faculty, especially junior faculty to continue to work beyond their contracts every year is wrong! even so, this is the way that administration has opted to treat faculty since i came to berea. it has only gotten worse from inside the “echo chamber.” to add insult to injury, the insurance benefits are deplorable. we used to have wonderful insurance before [year]. when questioned during the “town hall” meeting that spring, the president admitted he “dropped the ball” in oversight of the new insurance proposal. the dean at the time, was conveniently absent from that meeting. the result? i have not the salary to afford the best of plans available for myself and my family. my [partner/spouse] who works a much lower paying job, placed our children under her policy because….wait for it….it’s much better and cheaper! each and every time i visit a specialist, which unfortunately, i am required to do regularly, i have to pay the highest co-pay of anyone i know. the $60 co-pay has been called out by my doctors and their staff repeatedly. they tell me this is the highest they have seen. this made me question the reasoning. is the current quality of the benefits compensating for all the building projects and other expenditures on campus? i do not know, but i am certain that if berea college continues its neglect of faculty, its ability to provide students with a quality education will continue to suffer serious decline. this is not sustainable. therefore, it is quite obvious why faculty are becoming less and less motivated to give extra of themselves. no one appears to care in lincoln hall and any voice to bring this to their attention is blown off. we are worn out, feel neglected, and coming to work for the sole purpose of collecting a paycheck. again, it is such a terrible shame that administration neglects the needs of its most important human resource. we love our students and work to prepare them for changing the world. yet, in recent years i have discovered berea college granting millions of dollars to projects well beyond the purview of the college. for example, broke leg falls in magoffin county received a sizable grant, millions if i recall, after a tornado devastated the land that used to be a state roadside park. [redacted identifying information] although i am saddened by the destruction of such a beautiful area, i am saddened even more to know that money was given by berea college when salaries do not compensate its faculty! again, this is deplorable and inexcusable when its faculty and staff are neglected here on campus. i am further loathed to discuss the plethora of committees on campus, spc, fsc, fac, apc, coge, slc and so many more in the alphabet soup, ad hoc or otherwise. they appear to be nothing more than busy work for faculty and a distraction from the real needs and problems at the college. it adds to our workload and many of these are an utter and complete waste of time. much of the work could and should be accomplished by administration and their staff. besides, administration has already decided a course of action when proposals are brought before committees as well as general and college faculty. faculty and committee recommendations are ignored and explained away. the latest revision of the general studies curriculum was unveiled and declared, by the ad hoc committee in charge of creating it, as immune to both discussion and revision. administration allowed this to go forth. it was presented for a vote on the faculty floor to be simply accepted or rejected. the committee justified this because they provided “ample” opportunity for input during only a handful of meetings inconveniently scheduled for so many. the revision before in 2006 was discussed exhaustively by the faculty and rightly so. most committees are led by the sycophants with their hands in everything else on campus anyway. the privilege of “shared governance” is nothing more than a façade to give faculty and staff the impression that all faculty have a voice. moreover, office managers and secretaries, all those hired from in-house, are also said to be placed on these committees to provide clerical and other support. they are in reality, “political officers” that ensure the mandates of the administration are met. many function as if they’re the militant guards of institutional resources. along this line, office and building staff have assumed roles beyond their positions. i have witnessed more than once different staff berating faculty publicly and/or tattling on faculty to administrators, both inside and outside of various departments, to gain favor. i too have experienced this treatment more than once. unfortunately, this general atmosphere has fostered piety at a destructive level. can berea change the world? yes! but only one student, one course, one labor position, one class of graduates at a time. certainly, we need to think about how we can heal racial divides and rid humanity of the social injustice. because administration neither leads nor listens, we have cultured a faculty body that refuses to listen to others. those with opposing views are personally attacked in public gatherings. social justice warriors act inappropriately without considering all facets of a problem. when faculty aver the inhumanity of others with opposing, or worse, even moderate views and do not stop to consider the negative repercussions, why should we not be shocked when students reverberate and echo these actions? personal convictions strengthened by a sense of social piety and righteousness should not be license for incivility. nor should they excuse attempts to dehumanize others via ad hominin attacks. moreover, certain races, religions, and creeds are blamed for the world’s problems without thought for the fact that those who accuse, when holding power, could commit the same injustices as those they attack. we have seen this recently with respect to the middle east. when we mute the voices of others with opposing views from any group, we are slowly silencing ourselves in the future. i never imagined berea college, given its mission, would be this unwise. again, leadership is absent to the point that nobody’s in charge so everybody’s in charge! how does this manifest itself in the student body? we teach students to blame certain groups, religious, political, racial, or otherwise, regardless of character. for example, students have said that agriculture is evil because it involved slavery. do we not see social injustices occurring in other parts of the world in the past and today that do not involve agriculture? what warped thinking and vomitous speech! no one stops to think of the importance of agriculture or how it is being used and abused today! it’s simply labelled “evil,” period! students do not critically think about how to define or understand a problem? consequently, students do not know how to properly approach and solve problems to benefit all. no, let us judge one specific group as inhuman, lump everyone together, and vilify them, right? a vengeful attitude veiled under the righteous banner of social justice appears to be the result. nazi germany thought, felt, and acted in the same way! where is the critical thinking that is supposed to drive both general studies and each major’s programs. the words “critical thinking” are drawn like a weapon to justify curricular changes or improve pedagogy. again, these words look commanding on paper but in reality, contribute extraordinarily little in practice. the bottom line is…...if we’re supposed to be the educated leaders of our society, it’s no wonder that the academy is so distrusted in the nation.  one last thought involves our “recruitment” of international students. i have noticed many of these students act entitled. several expect advisors and instructors to drop everything to address their needs and it is not due only cultural differences with respect to these types of interactions. many act very haughty and feel free to criticize others, sometimes unknowingly, sometimes consciously. i have witnessed this increasingly over the last few years and it is getting worse. moreover, there are several that are driving tesla, bmw, and other luxury automobiles. nothing wrong with having wonderful things! however, we are supposed to be serving the underprivileged in our region. so, i have to stop and ask why so many international students from families with privileged status in their own countries matriculate here repeatedly! if they feel entitled, privileged, and have expensive items, it must be because they bring in money and/or have political influence. am i right? diversity is wonderful and especially so for those from appalachia that have experienced isolation from the larger world. nevertheless, we have to start focusing on the precepts upon which we were founded. we must start making a strong effort to focus once again on appalachia! how? first, i feel the president’s work should focus securing donations and making lasting relationships with those that influence policy. it is in extremely poor taste to solicit future donations from students during graduation ceremonies. i know some might disagree but one of our previous presidents was a lackluster advocate for securing funds off campus but readily petitioned students during commencement. other presidents have spent more time micromanaging departments, committees, administrators, and faculty. we have to get beyond this if we are to succeed. in conclusion, and i am sure you are glad for it, i am very, very troubled that i have complained so much about the current state of affairs in this document and this doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface. i could continue writing at least another 10 to 15 pages with so many more specific examples to illustrate the problems addressed herein. this is not the place, i feel, to do so. i also feel terrible for so many other colleagues that have had to also endure unneeded stress and underappreciation from lackluster attempts by administration to meet the needs of their faculty. berea college is a special place that could offer an even higher standard and quality of education to so many students in need. we cannot do so if faculty and staff, but especially faculty in the classroom, are not valued. if the leadership of this college does not change, this neglect will further work to undermine our service to appalachia and beyond. please don’t simply hear…...listen to us and to what we say we need to thrive….not just to survive!</span>
